        Lata Mangeshkar  (born as Hema Mangeshkar; 28 September 1929 – 6 February 2022) was an Indian playback singer and occasional music composer. She is widely considered to have been one of the greatest and most influential singers in India.[7][8] Her contribution to the Indian music industry in a career spanning seven decades gained her honorific titles such as the "Queen of Melody", "Nightingale of India", and "Voice of the Millennium".[9]
        Lata recorded songs in over thirty-six Indian languages and a few foreign languages, though primarily in Marathi, Hindi, and Bengali.[9] Her foreign languages included English, Russian, Dutch, and Swahili.[10] She received several accolades and honors throughout her career. In 1989, the Dadasaheb Phalke Award was bestowed on her by the Government of India.[11] In 2001, in recognition of her contributions to the nation, she was awarded the Bharat Ratna,
         India's highest civilian honour; she is only the second female singer, after M. S. Subbulakshmi, to receive this honour.[12] France conferred on her its highest civilian award, Officer of the National Order of the Legion of Honour, in 2007.[13]
        She was the recipient of three National Film Awards, 15 Bengal Film Journalists' Association Awards, four Filmfare Best Female Playback Awards, two Filmfare Special Awards, the Filmfare Lifetime Achievement Award and many more. In 1974, she was one of the first Indian playback singers to perform at Royal Albert Hall in London, UK. Her last recorded song was "Saugandh Mujhe Is Mitti ki" released on 30 March 2019 as a tribute to the Indian Army and the Nation.[14]
        At one point, she appeared in the Guinness World Records which listed her as the most recorded artist in history between 1948 and 1987

            Early life
        </strong><br>
        Lata Mangeshkar was born on 28 September 1929 in a Maharashtrian Brahmin family[16][17] the eldest daughter of Deenanath Mangeshkar, a Marathi and his wife Shudhamati, a Gujarati[18] in Indore (in the present-day Indore district of Madhya Pradesh and then the capital of the princely state of Indore which was part of the Central India Agency in British India). Her father, Deenanath, was a classical singer and theatre actor. Her mother, Shevanti (later renamed Shudhamati), a Gujarati woman from Thalner, Bombay Presidency (now in northwest Maharashtra), was Deenanath's second wife; his first wife Narmada, who had died, was Shevanti's older sister.[19]

Her paternal grandfather, Ganesh Bhatt Navathe Hardikar (Abhisheki), was a married Karhade Brahmin pujari who performed the abhisheka of the Shiva lingam at the Mangueshi Temple in Goa.[20] Her paternal grandmother, Yesubai Rane, was his Devadasi mistress from Goa.[21] Since Deenanath Mangeshkar's parents were not married to each other, he did not inherit his father's caste and surname but instead inherited his mother's caste status.[22] Her maternal grandfather, Seth Haridas Ramdas Lad, was from Gujarat, a prosperous businessman and landlord of Thalner. She learned Gujarati folk songs such as garbas of Pavagadh from her maternal grandmother.[23]

Deenanath adopted the surname Mangeshkar in order to identify his family with his native town of Mangeshi, Goa. Lata was named "Hema" at her birth. Her parents later renamed her Lata after a female character, Latika, in one of her father's plays, भाव बंधन.[24]

She was the eldest child in the family. Meena, Asha, Usha, and Hridaynath, in birth order, are her siblings; all are accomplished singers and musicians.[25]

She received her first music lesson from her father. At the age of five, she started to work as an actress in her father's musical plays (Sangeet Natak in Marathi). On her first day of school,[24] Mangeshkar left because she was not allowed to bring her sister Asha along with her
